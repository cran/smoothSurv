==========
* new macro __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ defined in Scythe_Error.h to avoid back compatibility problems with some compilers (thanks to B. Ripley)
* all instances of __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ replaced by __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ 
  in files: Scythe_Matrix.h (8x)
            Scythe_Matrix_Iterator.h (4x)
            Scythe_IDE.cpp (20x)
            Scythe_LA.cpp (11x)

* bug in Scythe_Matrix.cpp (in Submatrix operator) fixed

* operations of the type "int / SCYTHE::Matrix<double>" and "SCYTHE::Matrix<double> / double" which were declared as illegal by Sun's compilers (thanks to B. Ripley) fixed
