==========
* bug fixed in estimTdiff (estimTdiff did not work correctly when there was only 1 covariate in a model)

12/06/2009
==========
* computation of confidence intervals added to estimTdiff
* print.estimTdiff adjusted to give nicer output when there are no covariates in the model

27/04/2009
==========
* lines fit.logn$failure <- 2; fit.logl$failure <- 2; fit.weib$failure <- 2 in smoothSurvReg.R commented
  due to changes in survival package in R 2.9.0 (argument 'failure' is no more included in survreg.control)

26/06/2008
==========
* #include <cstdlib> added to Scythe_Error.h to let abort() work also with g++ 4.3
* estimTdiff.smoothSurvReg will no more work when logscale.cov1 and logscale.cov2 are specified

14/08/2007
==========
* new macro __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ defined in Scythe_Error.h to avoid back compatibility problems with some compilers (thanks to B. Ripley)
* all instances of __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ replaced by __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ 
  in files: Scythe_Matrix.h (8x)
            Scythe_Matrix_Iterator.h (4x)
            Scythe_IDE.cpp (20x)
            Scythe_LA.cpp (11x)
            Scythe_Math.cpp (7x)
            Scythe_Matrix.cpp (43x)
            AKMatrix.cpp (2x)

* bug in Scythe_Matrix.cpp (in Submatrix operator) fixed

* operations of the type "int / SCYTHE::Matrix<double>" and "SCYTHE::Matrix<double> / double" which were declared as illegal by Sun's compilers (thanks to B. Ripley) fixed
