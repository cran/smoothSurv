24/09/2017 (version 2.0)
=========================
* registration of C routines
* correction of data.frame arithmetic inconsistency

27/07/2015 (version 1.6)
=========================
* NAMESPACE updated by imports from standard packages graphics and stats

05/02/2015 (version 1.5)
========================
* CITATION file updated (desc changed to meta)

24/04/2014
==========
* small piece of code added to smoothSurvReg function to treat non-zero fail
  of any type when doing the grid search for optimal lambda
* confint.smoothSurvReg implemented

06/01/2012
==========
* NAMESPACE added
* MP.pseudoinv function (smoothSurvReg.fit.R): La.eigen replaced by eigen.

30/05/2010
==========
* erf and erfc in gauss.h and gauss.cpp changed to erfAK, erfcAK
  (there were some conflicts with /usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h reported by CRAN checks)

14/01/2010
==========
* bug fixed in estimTdiff (estimTdiff did not work correctly when there was only 1 covariate in a model)

12/06/2009
==========
* computation of confidence intervals added to estimTdiff
* print.estimTdiff adjusted to give nicer output when there are no covariates in the model

27/04/2009
==========
* lines fit.logn$failure <- 2; fit.logl$failure <- 2; fit.weib$failure <- 2 in smoothSurvReg.R commented
  due to changes in survival package in R 2.9.0 (argument 'failure' is no more included in survreg.control)

26/06/2008
==========
* #include <cstdlib> added to Scythe_Error.h to let abort() work also with g++ 4.3
* estimTdiff.smoothSurvReg will no more work when logscale.cov1 and logscale.cov2 are specified

14/08/2007
==========
* new macro __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ defined in Scythe_Error.h to avoid back compatibility problems with some compilers (thanks to B. Ripley)
* all instances of __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ replaced by __AK_PRETTY_FUNCTION__ 
  in files: Scythe_Matrix.h (8x)
            Scythe_Matrix_Iterator.h (4x)
            Scythe_IDE.cpp (20x)
            Scythe_LA.cpp (11x)
            Scythe_Math.cpp (7x)
            Scythe_Matrix.cpp (43x)
            AKMatrix.cpp (2x)

* bug in Scythe_Matrix.cpp (in Submatrix operator) fixed

* operations of the type "int / SCYTHE::Matrix<double>" and "SCYTHE::Matrix<double> / double" which were declared as illegal by Sun's compilers (thanks to B. Ripley) fixed
