Description: Contains, as a main contribution, a function to fit
             a regression model with possibly right, left or interval
             censored observations and with the error distribution
             expressed as a mixture of G-splines. Core part
             of the computation is done in compiled 'C++' written
             using the 'Scythe' Statistical Library Version 0.3.
